Problem:
There is no port 6379 open for redis in the server.

Solution:
Allow firewall rules
1.switch to root and use "ufw allow 6379/tcp"
2.check with "ufw status numbered"
3.restart the redis server " systemctl restart redis.service"
4.Check the listen port " ss -ntl"
5.check with redis-cli ping and we get PONG
