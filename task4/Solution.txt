Problem:
The user identity is not set properly

Solution:
In IIS --> go to application pools --> in the server find the application pool for the default site -->select  and go to advanced settings ,select the identity and change the user to Localsystem.If any user added means we want add that username and password

Then click the applicationpool and select Recycle to restart .
